# REACT Exercises

Let's try to design the header https://diracai.com/


##  Exercises

  -  1. Add two more navigation buttons in the header "CAREER" and "PRODUCTS" 
  -  2. Show a dropdown menu onClick on "PRODUCTS". i.e. When you click on "PRODUCTS", it should show "TEACHING PLATFORM" as in the diracai.com 
  -  3. Write all pages as individual components and import them to App.js. Right now we are writing everything in code. But we need to oragnize little bit i.e.split the main code into few components so that number of lines inside App.js will be reduced. Suggestion is to write Homepage, Contactus Page, Team Page, Career page as 4 separate components. You may name those as HomePage.js, ContactUsPage.js , TeamPage.js and CareerPage.js . Once you have done creating these 4 separate codes , you can import those to App.js as follows

    `import HomePage from './HomePage'`
